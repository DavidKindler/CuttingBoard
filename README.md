# CuttingBoard

A web-based cutting board designer. Runs fully client-side, designs can be saved by bookmarking the URL or downloading to a JSON file.

If you just want to use it and don't care about the code, go to http://mvrens.github.io/CuttingBoard.

## Features
- Alternate strips on the end grain board, or customize the direction of each strip individually
- Allows for defining multiple boards with their own layer patterns, which can be combined into one end grain cutting board in any order and direction
- Wood species can be added or customized
- Printing support, with options to select what gets printed to save on paper (and use those trees on cutting boards instead!)
- Units in millimeters, centimeters and inches (decimal - fractional is on the ToDo list)
