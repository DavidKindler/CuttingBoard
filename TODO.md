ToDo
====

Should have
----
- Automatically switch to Custom direction when clicking a strip (preserving the directions currently on screen otherwise)
- Highlight strips for the current board, highlight layer for the focused/hovered layer
- Show list of end grain board numbers and reversed in a "Glue list" for printing
- Support for fractional inches (see, not all europeans look down on freedom units!)

Nice to have
----
- Show remaining material
- Theme selection for the preview background
- Render width and height of the boards in the previews (simplified version implemented, moved to Nice to have)
- Support for mixing multiple boards in the end grain version
- 3D effect for previews emulating thickness / crosscut width
- Actual wood textures
